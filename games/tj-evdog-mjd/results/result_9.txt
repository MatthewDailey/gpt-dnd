Great! You find yourself in the town of Oakhurst, a small village on the edge of a vast forest. The townspeople are friendly, but there is a sense of unease in the air. You overhear rumors of strange happenings in the forest, including sightings of mysterious creatures and strange lights at night.

As you explore the town, you come across a notice posted on the town square bulletin board. It reads:

"Adventurers Wanted! The town of Oakhurst is in need of brave souls to investigate the strange occurrences in the nearby forest. Inquire at the town hall for more information."

What do you do?
