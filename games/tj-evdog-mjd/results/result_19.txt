Miss Witch-a-lot casts a protection spell to shield herself and Thorvald from harm, and you both cautiously make your way into the ruins. As you get closer, you can see that the figures moving around inside are wearing dark robes and appear to be performing some kind of ritual around a large stone altar.

You hide behind a nearby pillar and observe the ritual for a few moments. The chanting grows louder and more intense, and you can feel a strange energy emanating from the altar. Suddenly, one of the robed figures notices you and points in your direction, shouting something in a language you don't understand.

What do you do next?
