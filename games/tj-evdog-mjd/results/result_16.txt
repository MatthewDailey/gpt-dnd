You decide to talk to the villagers to gather more information about the strange occurrences in the forest. You ask around and hear various rumors and stories. Some say they have seen strange lights at night, while others claim to have heard eerie howls coming from the forest. One villager even tells you about a group of travelers who disappeared while passing through the forest.

As you listen to the stories, you notice a pattern emerging. Many of the strange occurrences seem to be centered around a particular area of the forest, marked on the map as "The Old Ruins". It seems like a good place to start your investigation.

What do you do next?
