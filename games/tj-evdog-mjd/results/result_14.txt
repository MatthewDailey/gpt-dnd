Mayor Thistlewood looks at you skeptically, but after a moment of consideration, he agrees to your terms.

"Very well. I will offer you a reward of 150 gold pieces and a steak for your wolf companion. But please, be careful. We don't know what dangers lurk in the forest."

He hands you the gold and directs you to the forest's edge, where you can begin your investigation. What do you do next?
