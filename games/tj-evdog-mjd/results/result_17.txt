You decide to head to "The Old Ruins" to investigate the strange occurrences in the forest. As you make your way through the forest, you notice that the trees are thicker and the underbrush is denser than in other parts of the forest. You also notice that the wildlife seems to be avoiding the area.

After a few hours of hiking, you arrive at the ruins. The ruins are overgrown with vines and moss, and the stones are weathered and cracked. You notice that there are several entrances to the ruins, but they are all partially blocked by rubble and debris.

What do you do next?
