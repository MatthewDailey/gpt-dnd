Great choice! For your custom race, we can use the stats for the Elf race as a base and make some modifications to fit the High Fae. Your character will have a +2 bonus to Dexterity and a +1 bonus to Intelligence. As a powerful witch, you will be a spellcaster and have access to a variety of spells to use in combat and other situations.
