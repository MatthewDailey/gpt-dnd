You and Thorvald make your way to the town hall, where you find a group of nervous-looking villagers gathered around a table. A middle-aged man with a stern expression greets you.

"Greetings, adventurers. I am Mayor Thistlewood. We are in dire need of your help. Strange things have been happening in the forest, and we fear for the safety of our town. Will you help us investigate?"

He hands you a map of the forest and points out the areas where the strange occurrences have been reported. He also offers a reward of 100 gold pieces for any information or assistance you can provide.

What do you do?
