Sure! Based on Thorvald being a ranger with a wolf companion, I would recommend the following ability score distribution:

- Strength: 14
- Dexterity: 15
- Constitution: 12
- Intelligence: 8
- Wisdom: 14
- Charisma: 8

This gives him a good balance of physical and mental abilities, with a focus on Strength and Dexterity to support his archery and combat skills, and Wisdom to support his tracking and survival skills. His AC would be 12 (10 + 2 Dexterity modifier).
