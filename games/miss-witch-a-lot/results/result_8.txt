Sure! Based on your character being a powerful witch, I would recommend the following ability score distribution:

- Strength: 8
- Dexterity: 14 (+2 racial bonus = 16)
- Constitution: 10
- Intelligence: 15 (+1 racial bonus = 16)
- Wisdom: 12
- Charisma: 8

This gives you a good balance of physical and mental abilities, with a focus on Dexterity and Intelligence to support your spellcasting. Your AC would be 12 (10 + 2 Dexterity modifier).
