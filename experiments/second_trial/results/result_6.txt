As you start randomly pressing the raised symbols, you hear a faint clicking sound coming from the door. Suddenly, the door begins to slide open, revealing a dark passageway leading into the temple.

As you step inside, you notice that the air is musty and stale, and the walls are covered in moss and vines. You also notice that the floor is covered in dust and debris, as if no one has been here in a long time.

As you make your way deeper into the temple, you come across several traps and puzzles that you must solve to progress. Some of these include pressure plates that trigger dart traps, hidden switches that open secret doors, and riddles that must be solved to unlock the way forward.

After several hours of exploration and puzzle-solving, you come across a large chamber with a pedestal in the center. On the pedestal is a small golden statue of a sun god, surrounded by several precious gems and artifacts.

As you approach the pedestal, you hear a loud rumbling sound coming from the walls. Suddenly, the chamber begins to shake and dust falls from the ceiling. It appears that the temple is collapsing! What do you do?
