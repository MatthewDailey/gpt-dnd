As you inspect the carvings on the door, you notice that they depict various scenes from ancient history, including battles, sacrifices, and religious ceremonies. You also notice that there are several symbols repeated throughout the carvings, including a sun with rays emanating from it, a serpent coiled around a staff, and a pair of wings.

As you study the carvings, you notice that some of the symbols are slightly raised, as if they could be pressed like buttons. What do you do?
