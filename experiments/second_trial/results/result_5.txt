You ask around and learn that the other group of adventurers is a band of mercenaries who are known for their ruthlessness and willingness to do whatever it takes to get what they want.

Some people in the city fear that if Gruumsh and his mercenaries get their hands on the artifact, they will use it to seize power and become tyrants.
