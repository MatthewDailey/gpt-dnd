Great! Now that we have your characters, let's begin the adventure. 

You have heard rumors of an ancient temple deep in the jungle that is said to contain great treasures and artifacts. The temple is said to be guarded by traps and puzzles, and many adventurers who have attempted to explore it have never returned. 

Undeterred, you set out on a journey to find the temple and uncover its secrets. After several days of travel through dense jungle, you come across a clearing with a large stone structure in the center. This must be the temple you have been searching for.

As you approach the temple, you notice that the entrance is blocked by a large stone door with intricate carvings. It appears to be locked, but there are no visible keyholes or mechanisms. What do you do?
