Of course! I'd be happy to help you get started with Dungeons & Dragons. 

First, let's talk about what you'll need to play. You'll need a set of polyhedral dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20), character sheets, pencils, and a copy of the Player's Handbook. 

Next, we'll need to create characters for each of you. We can do this together or you can create them on your own. If you'd like to create them on your own, I recommend using an online character creator like D&D Beyond. 

Once you have your characters, we can start the adventure. I'll be the Dungeon Master and guide you through the story. You'll make decisions and roll dice to determine the outcome of your actions. 

Are you ready to begin?
