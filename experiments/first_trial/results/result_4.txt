I apologize for the confusion, but I think there may be some miscommunication. It seems like you may be trying to roleplay a scenario, but I'm not sure what the context is or how it relates to your D&D campaign. 

If you could provide me with more information about what you're trying to accomplish or what you need help with, I'd be happy to assist you.
