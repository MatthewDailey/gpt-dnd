The man's face lights up with gratitude. "Thank you, thank you so much! My daughter's name is Lily. She's a young girl, about 10 years old, with long brown hair and green eyes. She was wearing a blue dress when she disappeared."

He hands you a small piece of paper with a rough map of the surrounding woods. "This is the area where she was last seen. Please, find her and bring her back to me."

With that, the man turns and walks away, his shoulders slumped with worry. The villagers around you look at you with hope in their eyes. It's clear that they are counting on you to find the missing girl. What do you do next?
