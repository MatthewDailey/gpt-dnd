Excellent choices! Now that you have your characters, let's talk about the setting and story for your campaign. 

Do you have any preferences for the setting? For example, a medieval fantasy world, a post-apocalyptic wasteland, or a sci-fi universe? 

Once we have a setting in mind, we can start building a story around it. Do you have any ideas for what kind of adventure you'd like to go on? Maybe you want to explore a haunted castle, stop a group of bandits from raiding a nearby town, or investigate a mysterious cult that's been causing trouble in the area. 

Let me know your thoughts and we can start building your campaign from there!
