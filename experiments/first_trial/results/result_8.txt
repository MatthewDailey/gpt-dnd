Great! As you head towards the forest, you notice that the trees are tall and dense, and the underbrush is thick. The forest floor is covered in a layer of fallen leaves and twigs, making it difficult to move quietly. 

As you make your way deeper into the forest, you hear the sound of running water in the distance. You follow the sound and come across a small stream. The water is clear and cold, and you can see fish swimming in the shallows. 

As you continue along the stream, you notice a small clearing up ahead. As you approach, you see a figure sitting by the water's edge. It's a young girl, and she looks up as you approach. 

"Who are you?" she asks, her voice trembling. "Are you here to take me back to my father?"
