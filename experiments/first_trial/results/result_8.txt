As you make your way towards the forest, you notice that the sun is starting to set. You estimate that you have about two hours of daylight left before it gets dark. 

As you enter the woods, you can hear the sounds of birds and small animals rustling in the underbrush. The forest is dense and the trees are tall, casting long shadows across the forest floor. You follow the map, making your way towards the area where Lily was last seen.

After about an hour of walking, you come across a small stream. The water is clear and cold, and you can see fish swimming in the shallows. You cross the stream and continue on your way.

As you walk, you notice that the forest is getting darker and the sounds of animals are growing quieter. You realize that it's getting late and you'll need to find a place to camp for the night. What do you do?
