As you cast Detect Magic on the stream, you sense a faint magical aura emanating from the water. The aura is weak, but it seems to be coming from a small area near the center of the stream. 

You can't tell exactly what kind of magic it is, but it seems to be of a benign nature. It's possible that the magic is simply a natural occurrence in the area, or it could be related to something else entirely. 

The young girl looks at you curiously as you cast your spell. "What are you doing?" she asks.
