You cast Detect Magic on the stream, but you don't detect any magical auras. The stream seems to be a natural feature of the forest, and there's nothing unusual about it.

As you continue on your way, you eventually come across a small clearing. It's a good spot to camp for the night, as it's relatively flat and there's plenty of dry wood for a fire. You set up camp and take turns keeping watch throughout the night.

The night passes without incident, and you wake up feeling refreshed and ready to continue your search for Lily. What do you do next?
