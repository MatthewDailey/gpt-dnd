As a player, your character would know what they have learned through their backstory and any information they may have gathered through exploration or interaction with NPCs. 

If you're asking me as the Dungeon Master, I can provide you with some information about the area you're in. What kind of area are you in? Is it a town, a forest, a dungeon, or something else? 

Once I have a better understanding of the area, I can give you more information about what your character might know.
