I'd be happy to help you get started with Dungeons & Dragons. \\n\\nFirst, let's talk about what you'll need to play. You'll need a set of polyhedral dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20), character sheets, pencils, and a copy of the Player's Handbook. \\n\\nNext, we'll need to create characters for each of you. We can do this together or you can create them on your own. If you'd like to create them on your own, I recommend using an online character creator like D&D Beyond. \\n\\nOnce you have your characters, we'll need to decide on a setting and a story for your campaign. Do you have any preferences or ideas for what kind of adventure you'd like to go on? \\n\\nFinally, we'll schedule a time to play. Typically, D&D sessions last around 3-4 hours, so make sure you have enough time set aside. \\n\\nLet me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!\",\n  \"role\": \"assistant\"\n}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Yes we're ready play.\"}, <OpenAIObject at 0x110494400> JSON: {\n  \"content\": \"Great!
