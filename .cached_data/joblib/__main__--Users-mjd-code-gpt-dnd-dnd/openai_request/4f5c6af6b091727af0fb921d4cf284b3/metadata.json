I'd be happy to help you get started with Dungeons & Dragons. \\n\\nFirst, let's talk about what you'll need to play.

We can do this together or you can create them on your own. If you'd like to create them on your own, I recommend using an online character creator like D&D Beyond. \\n\\nOnce you have your characters, we can start the adventure. I'll be the Dungeon Master and guide you through the story.
